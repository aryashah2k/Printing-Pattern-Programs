Hello there 👋, and welcome to this awesome, well maintained repository that contains a huge collection of patterns and designs created using programming languages.

Many **Interview Questions and Programming Competitions** have one such question where we need to write code in order to *print a particular design or a pattern.*

*This repository tries to maintain all such patterns and aims to maintain code for all possible patterns and designs one could think of.*

**Practicing problems like these helps one understand looping constructs and build logic behind how to print any given pattern or design.**
